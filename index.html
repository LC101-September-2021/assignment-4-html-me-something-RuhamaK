                        I got my first glimpse of Singapore from the air as my plane landed at Changi international airport. This is one of the largest airports in Asia is a destination in itself. I was able to see a glimpse of what Singapore had to offer even before
                        I stepped into the city. Changi had a wide variety of shopping & dining options along with myriad attractions for every age group & interest. It would take longer than a day to explore everything 
                        Changi had to offer.

                        The island city-state of Singapore is only 719.7 kms in size. However jampacked into this tiny island is a diverse landscape of the modern and the ancient, sleek skyscrapers next to 
                        historical buildings. A bustling city that never sleeps with pockets of lush greenery & sleepy neighborhoods where time seems to have stopped. Some of the attractions that I was able to visit were:
                        The Merlion: Singapore's national monument, which has a lion's head & a fish's body. Gardens by the Bay: A nature park housing a diverse collection of plants frome every continent. The 18 avatar like supertrees were one of the highlights of this park. 
                        Chinatown & Little India, Sentosa Resort. Other popular tourist attractions:Singapore Zoo, Singapore Botanic gardens, Jurong Bird park.

                           Singapore is a food lovers paradise with every type of cuisine imaginable, from fine dining to street food. The variety of food available is mind boggling & will 
                           take more than a short vacation to experience. Singaporean cuisine is a mix of mainly Chinese, Indian & Malay flavors. 
                           Some of the local dishes that I enjoyed were: Chilli crab: Singapore's national dish. Laksa: A rich and spicy noodle soup. Satay: Skewered, grilled meat served with peanut sauce. Kaya toast: Coconut jam on toast

                           Singapore is a shopaholic's dream come true & you can find everything from high street fashion, luxury goods, the latest gadgets to pocket friendly bargain buys. It is easy
                           to make a bunch of impulse buys but if you set a definite budget you can come out without making a huge dent in your wallet. Orchard road with its plethora of malls & shopping centres
                           is a good place to get your shopping fix.
